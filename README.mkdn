        project  => 'myproject',
        username => 'mike',
        password => 'abc123',

# DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to programmatically upload files to [Google Code](https://googlecode.com).

It ships with an executable script for use on the command line: [googlecode\_upload.pl](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?googlecode\_upload.pl).

# METHODS

## new

Constructs a new `Google::Code::Upload` object. Takes the following key-value
pairs:

- username
- password (your Google Code password from [https://code.google.com/hosting/settings](https://code.google.com/hosting/settings))
- project
- ua - something that works like a [LWP::UserAgent](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::UserAgent) (_optional_)

## upload

Upload the given file to Google Code. Requires the following key-value pairs:

- file - the filename of the file to upload
- summary - the one-line summary to give to the file (defaults to the filename)
- description - text describing the upload in more detail (for example, the
changelog entry for this release)
- labels - an arrayref of labels like `Featured`, `Type-Archive` or `OpSys-All`

Returns the URL where the file can be downloaded if successful - otherwise, dies
with the HTTP status line.

You can also export the `upload` function, if you don't want to use OO style.
Instead of key-value pairs, specify the arguments in the following order:

    use Google::Code::Upload qw(upload);
    upload( $file, $project_name, $username, $password, $summary, $labels, $description );

# EXPORTS

You may optionally export `upload` to use this module in a non-OO manner.
