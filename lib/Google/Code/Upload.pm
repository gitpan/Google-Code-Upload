=head1 NAME

Google::Code::Upload - upload files to a Google Code project

=head1 VERSION

version 0.06

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Google::Code::Upload;
    my $gc = Google::Code::Upload->new(
        project  => 'myproject',
        username => 'mike',
        password => 'abc123',
    );
    $gc->upload(
        file        => 'README',
        summary     => 'README for myproject',
        labels      => ['Featured'],
        description => 'Hello world',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It's an incomplete Perl port of L<https://support.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scripts/googlecode_upload.py>

Basically you need L<googlecode_upload> script instead.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Constructs a new C<Google::Code::Upload> object. Takes the following key-value
pairs:

=over 4

=item username

=item password (your Google Code password from L<https://code.google.com/hosting/settings>)

=item project

=item ua - something that works like a L<LWP::UserAgent> (I<optional>)

=back

=head2 upload

Upload the given file to Google Code. Requires the following key-value pairs:

=over 4

=item file - the filename of the file to upload

=item summary - the one-line summary to give to the file (defaults to the filename)

=item description - text describing the upload in more detail (for example, the
changelog entry for this release)

=item labels - an arrayref of labels like C<Featured>, C<Type-Archive> or C<OpSys-All>

=back

Returns the URL where the file can be downloaded if successful - otherwise, dies
with the HTTP status line.

You can also export the C<upload> function, if you don't want to use OO style.
Instead of key-value pairs, specify the arguments in the following order:

    use Google::Code::Upload qw(upload);
    upload( $file, $project_name, $username, $password, $summary, $labels, $description );

=head1 EXPORTS

You may optionally export C<upload> to use this module in a non-OO manner.
